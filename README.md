## Usage

### Checking Password Strength
1. Enter your password in the input field
2. View real-time strength analysis
3. Check the following indicators:
   - Strength score
   - Estimated crack time
   - Requirement checklist
   - Detailed review

### Generating Secure Passwords
1. Click "Generate Password"
2. Review generated password
3. Click "Copy" to copy to clipboard
4. Use regenerate if needed

## How It Works

### Strength Calculation
The password strength is calculated using multiple factors:

```javascript
function calculateStrength(password) {
    // Entropy calculation
    // Character set complexity
    // Length analysis
    // Pattern detection
}
```

### Security Metrics

#### Entropy Calculation
```javascript
const entropy = Math.log2(Math.pow(charsetSize, length));
```

#### Time-to-crack Estimation
- Based on modern hardware capabilities
- Assumes 100 billion guesses per second
- Considers character set complexity
- Includes statistical analysis

### Security Features
- Client-side only processing
- No password storage
- Real-time analysis
- Comprehensive security checks

## Technical Details
### Dependencies
- No external libraries required
- Pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- Built for modern browsers
